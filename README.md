# Indian Council of Ministers
This dataset contains information on the Indian Council of Ministers between 1990 and 2021. The data has been carefully extracted and verified from the official website of the Cabinet Secretariat and a publication of the Lok Sabha secretariat titled “केंद्रीय मंत्रिपरिषद (1947 - 2011)” which documents the names and portfolios allotted to ministers in this time period. 

We table it in an orderly manner, to systematically place the information under variables such as name of the candidates, election year, party name, gender, portfolio, rank, start date of appointment, end date of  appointment, and constituency. Moreover, it has also incorporated various minister shuffles between the terms. The data also mentions the sources of information for each instance captured, so that users can verify the same. 

We have provided the documentation process in the following sections which lists the various sources and how they were used to populate the data. Moreover, we have also listed detailed exceptions that we came across while populating and checking the dataset, clarifying the assumptions we have made. 

As an attempt to produce a clear and thoroughly checked data, the sheet has undergone a number of checks and filters, in order to minimize the number of errors as possible. However, if you do detect any discrepancies in the data, please write to us at tcpd-contact@ashoka.edu.in. The codebook will be updated following the incorporation of any additional information. 

The users are free to download, display or include the data in other products for non-commercial purposes at no cost subject to these terms and conditions. If you do use this data, please cite the data as follows:
